Version 0.2.4 (08 May 2013):

  Bugs fixed:
    * Fix border drawing when compositing is disabled (bug #10021).

  Updated translations: Bulgarian, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan),
  Flemish and Indonesian.

Version 0.2.3 (21 April 2013):

  libnotify is now required as a dependency to build a test suite and to
  show improved notification previews.

  Features:o
    * Add a category to the settings dialog for Xfce4 Settings Manager.
    * Add widget names to summary ("summary") and body ("body") widgets
      to allow easier theming. Remove the redundant / buggy summary-bold
      style property (bug #8431).
      Themes will have to be updated accordingly.

  Bugs fixed:
    * Fix notifications not disappearing after clicking an action button.
    * Handle timeout correctly when smaller than fading time (bug #8580).
    * Avoid flickering of the notifications.
    * Accept uri of images in icon_name parameter.
    * Parse body with g_markup_escape_text which allows us to handle
      span attributes misused by some clients and to parse strings with
      "unusual" characters such as & (bug #7773, #8187).
    * Respect border-width when drawing the notification (bug #9475).
    * Do not kill notification daemon to apply new theme. Instead, handle
      style updates of existing notifications.
    * Show a button in the notification preview (bug #9982).
    * Add an icon to the notification preview.

  Updated translations: Arabic, Basque, Brazilian, Bulgarian, Castilian,
  Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Croatian, Danish, English, Finnish,
  Flemish, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Kazakh,

Version 0.2.0 (27 Nov 2010):

  Features:
    * Added man page for xfce4-notifyd-config from Evgeni Golov.
    * Support the 'reason' parameter of the NotificationChanged signal.
      Note that if you are using libnotify 0.4.4 or older, this will
      cause memory leaks in *applications* that use libnotify (not in
      xfce4-notifyd).  In this case, you should compile xfce4-notifyd
      passing the --enable-old-notification-closed-signature switch
      to configure.
    * Add summary-bold style property to allow themes to set the
      summary field of the notification bold (bug 5773).
    * Add the spec_version parameter to the GetServerInformation method.
      This behavior can be disabled by passing the
      --enable-old-get-server-information-signature flag to
      configure (bug 5602).
    * Make notifications unmovable (Jérôme Guelfucci, bug 5248).
    * Implement support for icon-only notifications (Canonical
      extension).
    * Implement support for "gauge" notifications (Canonical extension).
    * Added proper placement of notifications so they don't overlap when
      there are multiple on the screen.  This also uses a custom workarea
      calculation to avoid placing notifications where docked windows have
      set struts (Jérôme Guelfucci, bug 5248).
    * Port to libxfce4ui, drop libxfcegui4 dep (Romain Bouvier, bug 6375).
    * Add a preview button to the preferences dialog.

  Bugfixes:
    * Use correct COPYING file (GPLv2, not GPLv3).
    * Fix ugliness with rounded corners on windows sometimes, both with
      compositing enabled and disabled.
    * Check for exo-csource at configure time when needed (bug 5783).
    * Check for dbus-binding-tool at configure time.


Version 0.1.0 (24 Nov 2008):

  Initial release.  See TODO for known issues and unfinished features.
